c28wBGyKmi,Atoms,"<p>Nuclear energy is the energy of atoms. Learning about atoms—what they are, what they are made of, and how they behave—is a great way to start understanding nuclear energy.</p><p>You may have heard about atoms before. What you heard was probably a simplified explanation that doesn''t quite match reality. In this course, we will review what you may already know. And then we will go further and explore some of the interesting things that atoms can do.</p><p>We are going to explore lots of ways to think about atoms. We are going to look at atoms from different perspectives so that you walk away with a solid grasp of how they work and what they can do. That will help later when we dig into other concepts, such as how atoms split or combine in nuclear reactions.</p>",/images/courses/atoms/2D-gen3/B.svg,"<p>Topics covered in this course include:</p><ul><li>Definitions and descriptions of an atom</li><li>Parts of an atom and the purposes they serve</li><li>How everything fits together</li><li>The pictures and symbols (nomenclature) we use to represent atoms</li><li>What gives an atom its particular nature</li><li>Energy states: what happens when an atom gets excited</li><li>Elemental fun facts</li><li>Introduction to some familiar and important elements</li></ul><p>This is course on basic concepts, useful in a number of scientific disciplines. By the end, you will have a few ideas of areas to dive into for a deeper understanding.</p>",2024-06-10 22:03:11.745+00,<p>Atoms are the smallest bits of stuff. Everything is made of them.</p><p>When is the last time you thought about atoms? Chances are what you learned only scratched the surface of what we know. It's time for a refresher.</p><p>Learn how things work by starting with fundamentals. You are guaranteed to learn something new by taking this course. Come on in!</p>,
CihFljpP78,Pressurized Water Reactors (PWRs),"<p>The pressurized water reactor has generated more megawatts of power for the public than any other class of reactor.

RhdQxIfh0j,Gen IV Nuclear Power,"<p>Today''s nuclear power comes from so-called generation III power plants, which have operated safely for decades. Although major accidents have been minimal (any from Gen III?), the prospect of a disaster casts a shadow on the future nuclear. Gen IV nuclear is an attempt to bring nuclear power to more of the world safely and effectively.</p><p>Learn about the goals of gen IV nuclear. Get a review of the reactor types, fuel, and other materials used to raise the bar on nuclear power. Learn about reprocessing fuel to extract more value and reduce it to cooler, shorter-lived byproducts.</p><p>Gain confidence in nuclear power as a sustainable energy source for the future.</p>","",<ul><li>Gen IV goals</li><li>Reactor designs</li><li>Fuel types</li><li>Materials</li><li>Companies and government projects to realize Gen IV nuclear</li></ul>,,"<p>After a couple of high-visibility incidents, the world got cold feet about nuclear power.

5OtO3pCRbb,The Limits of Nature,"<p>Humanity has been tinkering with the steam engine for hundreds of years. In 1698, Thomas Savery, an English engineer, patented the first commercial steam-powered device for removing water from flooded mines.</p><p>Since then, through experimentation, pain-staking trial and error, and a bit of deep thinking, we have figured out the physics of heat energy, along with many effective ways of turning heat energy into useful work.</p><p>This introductory course explains the laws of thermodynamics, describes how water turns heat into work, and dives into the properties of water under pressure. These topics are directly related to using nuclear energy for power generation.</p>",/images/courses/limits-of-nature/steam-locomotive.jpg,<p>Taking this course will teach you:</p><ol><li>The laws of thermodynamics</li><li>Using water for work</li><li>What happens to water under pressure</li></ol>,2024-07-25 17:20:06.723+00,"<p>Do you want to understand how a nuclear power plant works, or a nuclear-powered submarine?
